<div class=" Education">
I went to Abraham Lincoln High School for education before my time at San Francisco State University. This was where I found interest in graphic design and video editing.
Fun Fact: In the cartoon: The Amazing World Of Gumball, the school that is featured in the show was modelled after the front of Abraham Lincoln High School. The only difference were that some parts of the building were recolored.
